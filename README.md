Project Goals: The Aim of this project is to develop a functional prototype that could be used in a real world situation, The program
should be developed to use a database to store and retrieve any records or information required by the user.

Our Project is an information Tracking System that is designed to be used by the irish police force, This application will allow them to
track a case during it's lifecycle, by tracking witnesses, Suspects, Vehicles relevent to a case and what forensic evidence is available
for a particular case.

The case is to be tracked up until the case has been processed by a court of law. When creating a case, it is assigned the status of open,
once the police members have been assigned to the case it's status is changed to in progress, this continues through until the case finally
ends as processed and then closed when it is archived.

The application will also be able to generate case overviews which will display to the user all the evidence attached to a case. It will 
be capable of creating monthly crime reports which will allow the polic to identify trouble area's and rates on specific crimes.
